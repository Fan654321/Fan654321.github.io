    <h1> Project 3</h1>
    <h4> Internship Leader: UX study for Zoom meeting platform</h4>
    <p>I was the team leader for the Zoom UX project in the IE lab during the last semester. This project was designed
        for our interns to help them understand the basic process and guide them to go through each step of a UX study.
        Finally, I wrote the UX report with the team together.
        Zoom, the virtual meeting platform, is one of the most popular tools for synchronous, digital communication.
        This platform is used in businesses, K-12 schools, and institutions of higher education. However, the research
        surrounds the user experience of Zoom is scarce. The goal of this UX study was to analyze the usersâ€™ experience
        of the Zoom meeting platform interface, including potential usability issues. Participants were asked to conduct
        everyday tasks within a Zoom meeting to help diagnose issues with the user interface design, if any.</p>
        <p>In this study, our team designed the study, collected the data, analyzed the data, and received the results. Interns
            clearly understood the process of a UX study. I was responsible for writing the final UX report, which taught
            me a lot. Also, communicating with an intern made me practice the skills regarding leadership.</p>
