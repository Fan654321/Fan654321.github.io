        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p class= "firstletter">As I come to a close on this journey, I would like to say I enjoy and appreciate this program. I
            recommend other students have a chance to experience this program, or at least to take some courses in the
            SISLT. The knowledge in this program is abundant, but the workload is affordable. Moreover, the
            communication with professors based on course contents enhanced the feeling of community, which was
            different than other online programs.</p>

        <p class= "textindent">I have learned many things from this program. Still, if I have to choose the most important one, I will
            say that is the learning process about the essential UX design elements such as interview skills, the strategy of
            recruitment, and data collections. Those chunks of knowledge will support me to systematically understand how
            to design UX study, rather than just reply on fragmentary personal experience.
            Moreover, going through the process of designing a UX study is also important to me. I can see the
            differences between “what I planned” and “what I did”. Also, I think the users are important. I “feel” the gap
            between the real users and my imagination.</p>

        <p class= "textindent">In the future, I plan to take more courses related to UX studies and design to improve my knowledge. I
            will discuss with my advisor and choose some courses. My research interests include UX studies. I hope my
            dissertation topic could be related to UX study.</p>
