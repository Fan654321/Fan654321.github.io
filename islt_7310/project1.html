    <h1> Project 1</h1>
    <h4>Course Project: 3D Learning Game Design by Unity</h4>
    <p>In the course 9486 - Advanced Designing Games for Learning, our team designed a 3D desktop game that
demonstrates examples of architecture and artifacts from various periods. Each period is housed on an island
that contains buildings, decorations, and plant life unique to that period. Each island is inhabited by a mentor
that will guide the learner on their quest. The mentors are based on influential, colored full real-life persons
famous for that period. The extravagant Baroque period, for example, is embodied in Borromini. An architect is
famous for his flamboyant disputes with his colleague Bernini. The purpose of this educational game design is
to help students distinguish between periods by creating an immersive learning environment that will explain the
details and influences of each period.</p>

<p>I learned the process of how to design a game. In this project, the most crucial thing I conducted was to test my
    idea and prototype. I interviewed players and observed users when they interacted with the game, which
    provided me feedback. This experience enhanced my skills in UX study.</p>
