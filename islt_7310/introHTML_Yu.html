    Greetings!
    My name is Fan Yu, originally from China. Now I live in Columbia, MO, with my dog Croissant. Currently, I am a PhD student at the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. My research interests include STEM education and UX study.
    I do not have any previous web application experience. I am excited to learn new skills from this course. I hope this course could give me a good start, which means this course helps me understand how to create a website, and then I can continue to learn the relevant knowledge by myself after finishing this course.  
    In my free time, I like hanging out with my friends and finding yummy food together. We always do BBQ in the summer.
