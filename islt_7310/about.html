        <p>I am originally from China. 
            <strong>Now</strong>, I live in Columbia, MO, with my dog Croissant. 
            I am a doctoral student in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri-Columbia. 
            I prefer to complete the program by <em>2023</em>. 
            <br />I am interested in learning technologies, STEM education, and user experience study for my current research interests. 
            <br />I hope to work on improving the UX design to help students improve their learning performance with technologies. 
            <br /><br />I received my Master’s Degree in Elementary Education Science at Missouri State University in Springfield, MO (2017). At the same time, I completed a certificate in Curriculum and Instruction.
            <br />After finishing my master’s degree, I worked as a product designer in China for three years. I designed
            education products for K-12 students and help them learn STEM knowledge outside school. 
            <br /><br />In my free time, I like hanging out with my friends and find yummy food together. We always do BBQ in the summer.</p>
        <h3>My favorite quote is:</h3>
        <blockquote>“Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another and feeling with the heart of another.” 
            <br />– Alfred Adler</blockquote>
        <p>I think the value of <em>empathy</em> is significant. As a designer, we need to understand our users. As a teacher, we
        need to understand our students.</p>
